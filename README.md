# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The data.js, the JavaScript array table that Dana has, is a dynamic table that can be adjusted as she wishes. Wherever and whenever she finds more information related to her web page, she physically adds data to this table without affecting the rest of the code or web page.  This dynamic web page will accept user input and adjust the page allowing user to filter using multiple criteria with the addition of table filters for city, state, country, shape, and date that was learnt in this Module. CSS, Bootstrap, HTML and DevTools are used to test our JavaScript to ensure the web page function as required and styling of our web page.

## Results
UFO sightings can happen anywhere across the globe, and Danaâ€™s web page has develope five different criteria for selection:
### 1 The date
Filtering the table by the first item in our filter table will allow the user to select any date for sightings that may have occured.
